## Philosophy

Like a typewriter, PrettyWriter keeps things simple:
- Just you, the machine, and the page
- Minimal formatting - focus on the first draft
- Keyboard shortcuts keep you in the flow
- No mousing about while you're writing

The first draft is never the best draft, but it's the most important one. You can't go anywhere without a first draft.
